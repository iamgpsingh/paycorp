Document Purpose / Intended Audience
This guide is intended to act a reference point for web/application developers seeking to implement Paycorp transaction functionality into merchant websites and web applications using the Paycorp API for Paycorp's REST web services.
Our API will generate the json messages for you and handles marshaling and un marshaling of json messages so that the merchant does not have to spend time writing code for these tasks.
Our API is currently available in Java, .NET and PHP. However, if you are using any other language you may directly integrate into our REST web services and a separate technical reference user guide is available on request    

It is assumed that the parties implementing this product will be experienced in the development and implementation of websites and web applications, this document is written principally toward parties with such expertise.
